# lcd-spi-st7735-micropython

Using display st7735 with Raspberry Pi Pico (micropython).

The ST7735.py file I got from [boochow](https://github.com/boochow/MicroPython-ST7735).

My idea is to write a script to use differents graphics displays such PCD8544, ILI9341 ST7735, but keeping a common pattern (when possible).
